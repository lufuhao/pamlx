Notes by Bo Xu May 30,2013

To built pamlX from the Command Line, switch to the source codes directory, then type two shell commands:

1) qmake
2) make release (or nmake release on Windows)

Make sure the computer have installed a C++ compiler(g++, msvc, xcode, ...) and Qt 4.8,
and their paths should be added correctly to the environment variable PATH.

Good luck.
